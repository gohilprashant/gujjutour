                Rani ki Vav, Patan is one of those rare UNESCO World Heritage Site that was built by a queen in memory of her king! Sort of like Taj Mahal, in reverse and one of the best places to visit in Gujarat. It is an ancient step-well, from the early 11th century, which was constructed by Udayamati in memory of Bhimdev I. With stairs that can take you down seven levels, it is home to more than 1,500 sculptures. The best part about it is that it has been discovered fairly recently, since the River Saraswati had flooded it in the earlier years, and it is only now that it has been excavated and become a popular tourist spot.
            </p>
            <p class="places-paragraph" >
                The main highlight of the stepwell is that its walls that are profusely ornamented with figurative motifs and showcases images of various god and goddesses and their consorts from the Hindu Pantheon. The central part of each storey contains the primary sculpture.
